			%p Coming soon to Beechwood â€“ a brand new development on a truly historic site. We are ModBox, a boutique property development firm with a vision that will transform Beechwood Village with inspired new residences and a marketplace for the entire community to enjoy.
			%p Introducing St. Charles Market. We've reimagined how to use this iconic property, which, for more than 100 years, was a gathering place for many communities. Designed by the award-winning Ottawa architecture firm, Linebox Studios, this development will feature unmistakably modern townhomes and stacked residences that wrap around the historic St. Charles Church (1908), creating an intimate village-within-a-village.
			%p At its heart is the former church with its landmark bell tower. Its interior will be carefully restored and adapted to accommodate a year-round market featuring carefully curated local vendors as well as cafes and restaurants. Outside the market and sandwiched between the residences will be beautiful and unexpected public spaces. A sculpture garden, a seasonal al fresco farmers market, patios and seating will all revive this site, making it a lovely and unique gathering place once again.
			%p Bringing new life to an incredible site... holy indeed!
